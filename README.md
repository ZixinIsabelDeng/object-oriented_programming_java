# Object-Oriented Programming Assignments in Java

## Description

This repository contains all the assignments completed during my Object-Oriented Programming course at school. The assignments are implemented in Java and cover a wide range of topics including data structures (like linked lists), exception handling, file I/O operations, binary file reading/writing, and more. Some highlights include a snake and ladder game and a book editor program.

## Contents

- `snake_and_ladder_game`: A simple text-based Snake and Ladder game showcasing the use of object-oriented concepts in game development. 

- `book_organizer`: A Java program representing a book editor that can verify, categorize, add, delete, and modify book information. Finding the error book file and write them into binary file. This assignment demonstrates file I/O operations and Exceptional handling.

- `book_editor`: This folder includes Java files showing the implementation of a circular linked list data structure.

- `exception_handling`: Contains examples of how to handle exceptions in Java.

- `binary_file_handling`: This is a Java program for reading from and writing to binary files.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

- JDK 11 or newer. The Java Development Kit (JDK) includes the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) and command-line development tools that are necessary to compile and run Java.

### Compiling and Running the Programs

- All the programs can be compiled using the `javac` command in the terminal or command prompt. For instance, if you want to compile `BookEditor.java`, navigate to its directory and type `javac BookEditor.java`.

- Once compiled, a Java bytecode file (`.class` extension) will be generated. This file can be run using the `java` command. For the `BookEditor.java` example, you would use `java BookEditor`.
